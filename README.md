## Hello, I'm InvestoCloud!

I design and secure cloud infrastructures that scale—without compromising security.

As a Professional Cloud Architect & Cloud Security Engineer, I protect multi-cloud environments (AWS & GCP) using Terraform, CI/CD automation, and real-time threat detection. My work bridges the gap between development and security, ensuring every deployment is secure, compliant, and resilient.

I transitioned from trucking to cloud engineering, proving it’s never too late to reinvent your career. I love tackling complex problems, learning new technologies, 
and helping teams automate everything from infrastructure to deployments.

🌱 Currently learning: Advanced CI/CD orchestration, Kubernetes clusters at scale, and Cloud Security best practices

🔭 Working on: Infrastructure Automation – Terraform, Pulumi, Helm, Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS), Istio, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Ansible, AWS CDK

🌍 Languages: Bash, Python, Powershell

⚡ Fun fact: I went from managing freight to managing cloud workloads—and now I help organizations ship faster in the cloud 🚛☁️
